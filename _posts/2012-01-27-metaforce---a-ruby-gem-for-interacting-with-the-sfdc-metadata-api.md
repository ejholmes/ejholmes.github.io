I'd like to introduce you to a little pet project I've been working on in my
spare time; [Metaforce](https://github.com/ejholmes/metaforce). Metaforce is a
Ruby gem that abstracts the [Salesforce Metadata API](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_meta/index.htm),
which is a Soap based API for CRUD'ing metadata on Salesforce organizations.
