title: The Arduino Focuser

h1. {{ page.title }}

In case you've never heard of it, the "Arduino is a tool for the design and development of embedded computer systems, consisting of a simple open hardware design for a single-board microcontroller, with embedded I/O support and a standard programming language." In other words, it kicks ass.

This is where I decided to start my homemade <a href="http://ascom-standards.org/">ASCOM</a> compliant computerized focuser. My goal was to use the Arduino to control a single stepper motor that in turn would be controlled by auto focusing software such as MaximDL or FocusMax using an ASCOM driver.

h2. The Hardware

The stepper motor I'm using is an old stepper I had from a single axis drive system for and EQ3 mount. I haven't looked into it but I think it has a fairly high resolution at around 0.5 degrees per step.

In order to control the stepper motor, I came across a <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/">motor shield</a> by Adafruit Industries. It also included a <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/use.html">library</a> for microstepping, which made it ideal for high precision focus control. The stepper motor is connected to the Arduino board via the motor shield through an RS232 cable.

h2. The Software

The <a href="http://github.com/ejholmes/Arduino-Focuser--ASCOM-Driver-">ASCOM driver</a> (written in C#) talks to the <a href="http://github.com/ejholmes/Arduino-Focuser--Embedded-">embedded software</a> via the virtual serial port created by the Arduino driver. The ascom driver issues commands such as ": M 1000 #", while the board parses those commands and acts accordingly. Parsing was not such an easy task but thanks to the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Messenger">Messenger library</a> (slightly modified) it was made much simpler. Still, it brings back nostalgic memories of RESTful API's.

h2. The Final Product
It supports absolute positioning of the focuser up to around 13,000 points (on my focuser) of focus.
