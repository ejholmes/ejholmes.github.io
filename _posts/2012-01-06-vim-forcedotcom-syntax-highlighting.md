title: Force.com syntax highlighting for VIM
tags: [Force.com]

I despise Eclipse and the Force.com IDE; it's an extremely bloated piece of software. Thanks to [Eclim](http://eclim.org/), it's possible to take advantage of the good parts of Eclipse but use VIM to edit apex classes, visualforce pages, etc.

I've released a small set of VIM scripts for syntax highlighting Apex, Visualforce and Apex logs, which is available for [download on Github](https://github.com/ejholmes/vim-forcedotcom).
