		<p><img class="right" src="http://arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/arduino316.jpg" alt="Arduino" />In case you&#8217;ve never heard of it, the &#8220;Arduino is a tool for the design and development of embedded computer systems, consisting of a simple open hardware design for a single-board microcontroller, with embedded I/O support and a standard programming language.&#8221; In other words, it kicks ass.</p>
<p>This is where I decided to start my homemade <a href="http://ascom-standards.org/"><span class="caps">ASCOM</span></a> compliant computerized focuser. My goal was to use the Arduino to control a single stepper motor that in turn would be controlled by auto focusing software such as MaximDL or FocusMax using an <span class="caps">ASCOM</span> driver.</p>
<h2>The Hardware</h2>
<p>The stepper motor I&#8217;m using is an old stepper I had from a single axis drive system for and EQ3 mount. I haven&#8217;t looked into it but I think it has a fairly high resolution at around 0.5 degrees per step.</p>
<p>In order to control the stepper motor, I came across a <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/">motor shield</a> by Adafruit Industries. It also included a <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/use.html">library</a> for microstepping, which made it ideal for high precision focus control. The stepper motor is connected to the Arduino board via the motor shield through an RS232 cable.</p>
<h2>The Software</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://github.com/ejholmes/Arduino-Focuser--ASCOM-Driver-"><span class="caps">ASCOM</span> driver</a> (written in C#) talks to the <a href="http://github.com/ejholmes/Arduino-Focuser--Embedded-">embedded software</a> via the virtual serial port created by the Arduino driver. The ascom driver issues commands such as <code>: M 1000 #</code>, while the board parses those commands and acts accordingly. Parsing was not such an easy task but thanks to the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Messenger">Messenger library</a> (slightly modified) it was made much simpler. Still, it brings back nostalgic memories of RESTful API&#8217;s.</p>
<h2>The Final Product</h2>
<p>It supports absolute positioning of the focuser up to around 13,000 points (on my focuser) of focus.<div class="flash"><object width="410" height="252"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/buo05pGONkw&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/buo05pGONkw&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="410" height="252"></embed></object></div></p>
